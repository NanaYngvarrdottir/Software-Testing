;; New module, City Builder, allows for the construction of a city using a random seed value,
;; import data for a city from other things like games, for example GTA IV for the pc. A
;; final option is to allow a city that has been generated or imported to age, for the cities
;; buildings to change over time, this is not so much an ageing process of the buildings themselves
;; but more of how the city develops and expands over time.

	;; the way in which the buildings are to be constructed, at some point in the future when

	CentralRegionCount = 1
	;; This value indicates the size of the city in terms of regions, minimum is 1. Maximum is
	;; dependant upon the server which is running Aurora. Note that the number is always squared
	;; so 1 gives a single city region, where as 2 gives (2 * 2) 4 regions in total, 3 gives 9

	;; small for now to save typing.

;; EXTRA NOTES
;;
;; Note that duplicate regions are not checked for so if you run Aurora create a city, shutdown
;; or restarts Aurora the previous city will still have regions and can overlap with the creation
;; of another city after restart. Also note cities are not saved to disk/database for later retrieval
;; yet.
